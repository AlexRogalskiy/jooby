# &infin; do more, more easily

Introducing [Jooby](http://jooby.org) a minimalist web framework for Java 8 or higher.

* **Solid**. Build on top of mature technologies.

* **Scalable**. Stateless application development.

* **Fast, modular and extensible**. So extensible that even the web server is plugable.

* **Simple, effective and easy to learn**. Ideal for small but also large scale applications.

* **Ready for modern web**. That requires a lot of JavaScript/HTML/CSS
