 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * Sessions are created on demand from {@link Request#session()}.
 *
 * Sessions have a lot of uses cases but most commons are: auth, store information about current
 * user, etc.
 *
 * <h1>Session configuration</h1> <h2>Session timeout</h2>
 * <p>
 * Session timeout is defined by the <code>application.session.timeout</code> property, by default a
 * session will be invalidated after 1800 seconds (30 minutes) of inactivity. Alternative, you can
 * set session timeout from {@link Definition#timeout(int)}.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Session persistence</h2>
 * <p>
 * Session data can be persisted, in order to do that you must provide an implementation of
 * {@link Session.Store}. Sessions are kept in memory, by default.
 * </p>
 * Sessions are persisted every time a request exit if they are dirty. A session get dirty if an
 * attribute is added or removed from it.
 * <p>
 * The <code>application.session.saveInterval</code> property indicates how frequently a session
 * will be persisted. Again, it will be persisted at the time a request exit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In short, a session is persisted when: 1) are dirty; or 2) save interval is expired it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Finally, the <code>application.session.preseverOnStop</code> indicates whenever existing session
 * need to be store at exit time (persisted) or not (invalidated). By default session are preserved
 * on stop.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Cookie configuration</h1>
 * <p>
 * A cookie will be created when a session is created. Cookie is signed using
 * <code>application.secret</code>. For {@link Mode dev mode} the default secret is set to the
 * location of the Jooby class. For others an <code>application.secret</code> MUST be set, otherwise
 * the application will fail at startup.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>application.session.cookie.name</code> indicates the name of the cookie that hold the
 * session ID, by defaults: <code>jooby.sid</code>. Cookie's name can be explicitly set with
 * {@link Cookie.Definition#name(String)} on {@link Session.Definition#cookie()}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>application.session.cookie.maxAge</code> sets the maximum age in seconds. A positive
 * value indicates that the cookie will expire after that many seconds have passed. Note that the
 * value is the <i>maximum</i> age when the cookie will expire, not the cookie's current age.
 *
 * A negative value means that the cookie is not stored persistently and will be deleted when the
 * Web browser exits. A zero value causes the cookie to be deleted.
 *
 * Default maxAge is: <code>-1</code>.
 *
 * Cookie's name can be explicitly set with {@link Cookie.Definition#name(String)} on
 * {@link Session.Definition#cookie()}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A session cookie is marked as secure and httpOnly.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please note that session data is NOT persisted in the cookie, just the session ID. If need to
 * persist a session, see {@link Session.Store}
 * </p>
