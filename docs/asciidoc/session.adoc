== Session

Session is accessible via 

- javadoc::Context[sessionOrNull]: which find an existing session
- javadoc::Context[session]: which find an existing session or create a new one

Sessions have a lot of uses cases but the most commons are: authentication, storing information 
about current user, etc.

A session attribute must be a String or a primitive. The session doesn't allow storing of arbitrary 
objects. It's intended as a simple mechanism to store basic data (not an object graph).

Jooby provides two javadoc::SessionStore[] implementation:

- In-Memory sessions - which you should combine with an a sticky sessions proxy if you plan to run multiple instances.
- Cookie sessions signed with a secret key
